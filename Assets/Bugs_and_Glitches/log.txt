-Attacks Clipping: sword attack clips through objects, even when character is supposed to be behind them

-Sword Object Appears when Attacked: when being attacked, if player character presses 'Attack' at the right time, the 'sword' object appears on top of the character as a massive sword

-Attack Sounds Don't Match Animation: when player quickly presses the 'Attack' button in quick succession, the sound of the attack does not match the timing of the attack animation

-Objects and Collision Box: Most objects in the world have collision boxes that players cannot enter even when the object themselves are not in the shape of a box; examples are trees and rocks

-Shooting Boxes Makes Wrong Sound: When the player shoots at the wooden boxes, they play the soundfile for when a sword hits them

-Slimes Continue to Move when Dead: After 'killing' the slimes, they continue to move around for a few more seconds until their death animation plays

-Slimes Instant Attack: Slime attacks come too fast, and they can change the direction of the attack mid-animation.
