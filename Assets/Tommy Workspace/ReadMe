Deleted all files on my section. Will upload my files via zip files with a corresponding date with details in the ReadMe.


Version 1.0
    Forest Maps and Space Maps have been created. Only lacking a forest map with the crashed spaceship.
        At this time, it may not be feasible to create a village.
        Shortcut in the initial map could possibly not be created, due to time constraints.
    Issue with the dialogue boxes was discovered and a solution was found, however unsure if this solution works for all resolutions.
    Story has been created; flavor text and details added for story depth.
    Unifying code with Dzuy's code has yet to be implemented. Will focus on trying to unify some aspects on Monday Nov 27, 2017.
