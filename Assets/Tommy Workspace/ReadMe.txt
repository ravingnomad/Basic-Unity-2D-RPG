So far this is the work that I have gotten done. I watched a youtube video that explains on how to create dialogue boxes and this is what I've got so far. It's a basic window with text. Probably needs to be altered accordingly to fit whatever we plan on doing.
So far it has the following functions.

Can specify NPC name.
Can specify dialogue.
The dialogue box can open and close.
The dialogue shows up letter by letter.

Functions we can consider for the future:
Add NPC sprite next to NPC name.
Other functionality.
