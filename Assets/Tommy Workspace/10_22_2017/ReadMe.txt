This is the latest updates that I have so far.

Changes:
Using the basic movement that was in the GitHub,
I made an NPC character that we are able to talk to.
Using the 'e' button, we can speak to the NPC.
I tried putting the space button earlier but it caused some issues.
Thus so far we can talk with 'e'.
I tried changing the continue button to be usable with the 'e' button
however it hasn't been working so I removed it for now.
